# μPLAN: Summarizing using a Content Plan as Cross-Lingual Bridge

This repository includes the  plan-annotated data used in our [µPLAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14205) (EACL 2024).

## Abstract

Cross-lingual summarization aims to generate a summary in one language given input in a different language, allowing for the dissemination of relevant content among different language speaking populations.  The task is challenging mainly due to the paucity of cross-lingual datasets and the compounded difficulty of summarizing *and* translating.
This work presents µPLAN, an approach to cross-lingual summarization that uses an intermediate planning step as a cross-lingual bridge. We formulate the plan as a sequence of entities capturing the summary's content and the order in which it should be communicated. Importantly, our plans abstract from surface form: using a multilingual knowledge base, we align entities to their canonical designation across languages and generate the summary conditioned on this cross-lingual bridge and the input. Automatic and human evaluation on the  XWikis dataset (across four language pairs) demonstrates that our planning objective achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of informativeness and faithfulness. Moreover, µPLAN models improve the *zero-shot* transfer to new cross-lingual language pairs compared to baselines without a planning component.


## Data
The plan-annotated dataset is available in JSONL format at: [link](link-to-GCP-bucket-tbd). This dataset is derived from [XWikis (Perez-Beltrachini
and Lapata, 2021)](https://github.com/lauhaide/clads). Each *(document, summary)* pair is annotated with a multilingual content plan, stored under the data key `plan`.

## Models
All the models in the paper are based on the [mT5 model (Xue et al., 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.41.pdf) using the checkpoints available at: [link](https://github.com/google-research/multilingual-t5?tab=readme-ov-file#released-model-checkpoints).
